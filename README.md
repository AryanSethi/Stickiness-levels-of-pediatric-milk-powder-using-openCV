# Stickiness-levels-of-pediatric-milk-powder-using-openCV
Part of an actual real life problem faced by a pedietric milk powder formula making company. The goal of the project is to determine how much undissolved powder is stuck on the walls on bottles using openCV and image processing.

We all must have encountered at some part of our lives that sometimes there are blobs that are struck on milk bottles which doesn't look nice. We tried to create an automated way to test the stickness and grease-formation capacity of different pediatric milk powder formuae. Analysed the graphs for days to find perfect imaging threshholds for different conditions.

The above is a histogram for different images and greassiness levels we tested.

Below is an example showing how we seperated blobs and grease and made it automated.

Original blobs and grease looks somehting like :
